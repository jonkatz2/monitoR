PACKAGE OVERVIEW
The monitoR package is designed for bioacoustic detection and monitoring. Two
different approaches are available for detecting animal vocalizations within
recordings: binary point matching and spectrogram cross-correlation. Both
require development of a template, which is easy to make once a suitable
recording has been identified. Additional monitoR functions provide tools for
extracting and evaluating results; saving and reading templates; and managing a
complete monitoring program, including connecting with a MySQL database.

INSTALLATION
You can install monitoR from CRAN directly in R using the menus or with:
